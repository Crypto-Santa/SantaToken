The airdrop will happen on or before December 25, 2017. We will issue SantaTokens in the order bids were received, until all 12000 SantaTokens run out. For each 1 ETH in your wallet, 1 SantaToken will be issued. Maximum limit of SantaTokens you can get is 12 (face value of 12 ETH). If you do not have 12 ETH in your wallet, you will get less SantaTokens.
